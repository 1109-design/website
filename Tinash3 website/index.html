        	My name is Tinashe Chaitezvi. I'm 19 years old. I'm currently studing Software Engineering at <a href="www.hit.ac.zw" target="self">Harare Institute of Technology.</a>I started my studies there in August 2019.

        		I did my High School at Saint Alberts High School  from  Form 1 to Form 6.With the dream of getting into IIT, I started with JEE training.The first semester just went on with the flow as it is a completely a new environment transforming from school to college.At first i was a bit confused about what i was really studying.With the entry into second semester,i came to know about the coding club started by our seniors and started actively participating in it.

            	Slowly i started solving problems in online platforms along with my roomate.I got so much interest in it  and problem-solving have become a habit for me.It is then, i realized getting top in college courses is not the ultimate goal,but doinh what you love is more important.This discovery helped me  alot but also made me to subotage some other  courses except programming ones which is not OK.I have decided to get good at problem-solving and python(respect to this programming language!!)

            <p>
            	During the lockdown first months, i did nothing except relaxing and spending time with my family.After that, i have again started with python and doing contents on CodeChef and CodeForces.I have teamed up wiht fellow programmers online and we were practicing it in a group. I always felt doing it in a group is better as it will help to stay disciplined and easy to discuss the problems e.t.c.

            	<b>Currently, i'm working on projects. I haven't  come up  with the idea yet but i know that if i  put the work in zvinoita lol.I think having a project on my resume will give me an edge while applying for jobs.</b>
            	As for now i don't know how to get into good product based companies.
